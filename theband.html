                    <p>The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. Their original line-up consisted of the American actor/musicians Micky Dolenz, Michael
                        Nesmith, and Peter Tork with English actor/singer Davy Jones. The group was conceived in 1965 by television producers Bob
                        Rafelson and Bert Schneider specifically for the situation comedy series The Monkees, which aired from 1966
                        to 1968. The band's music was initially supervised by record producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy
                        Boyce and Bobby Hart.

                    <p>The four actor/musicians were initially allowed only limited roles in the recording studio for the first few months of their five-year career as "the Monkees". This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television
                        series. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning, and Tork contributed limited guitar work
                        on the sessions produced by Nesmith. All four contributed lead vocals to various tracks. They eventually
                        fought for the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name, acting as musicians, singers,
                        songwriters, and producers.

                        Dolenz, his band's live stage act included rock songs, cover songs, and even some R&B, one of his favorite songs to sing being
                        Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode". "Johnny B. Goode" was the song Dolenz sang at his Monkees audition,
                        resulting in his being hired. He cut two 45s in 1965 that went unreleased until The Monkees' success in 1967. Those two 45s
                        came out on the Challenge label and the songs were "Don't Do It"/"Plastic Symphony III" and "Huff Puff"/"Fate
                        (Big Ben)".

                    <p class="bio"><strong>Bio: </strong>Tork was a proficient musician before he joined The Monkees, and though other members of the group were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he had played what he described as "third
                        chair guitar" on Michael Nesmith's song "Papa Gene's Blues" on their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass
                        guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along with Joey Richards,
                        the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake". On the show, he was relegated to acting as the 
                        "lovable dummy", a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in New York's Greenwich Village.

                    <p class="bio"><strong>Bio: </strong>After a tour of duty in the Air Force, Nesmith was given a guitar as a Christmas present from his mother and stepfather. Learning as he went, he played solo and in a series of working bands, performing folk, country,
                        and occasionally rock and roll. His verse poems became the basis for song lyrics, and after moving to Los Angeles with Phyllis
                        and friend John London, he signed a publishing deal for his songs. Nesmith's "Mary, Mary" was recorded
                        by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, while "Different Drum" and "Some of Shelly's Blues" were recorded by Linda Ronstadt and 
                        the Stone Poneys. "Pretty Little Princess", written in 1965, was recorded by Frankie Laine and released
                        as a single in 1968 on ABC Records. Later, "Some of Shelly's Blues" and "Propinquity (I've Just Begun to Care)" were made 
                        popular by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on their 1970 album Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy.

                    <p class="bio"><strong>Bio: </strong>From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he
                        was the only Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert 
                        Schneider's standards.[14] Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free"
                        and "Daydream Believer".[14] The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. 
                        In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups
                        been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky
                        Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and
                        Dolenz on drums). Mostly playing tambourine or maracas, Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.
